**Iris Dataset Visualization and Analysis**https://github.com/Akhileshwar-2509/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-the-Iris-Dataset


This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. The analysis covers univariate, bivariate, and multivariate aspects of the dataset to provide insights into the characteristics and relationships of the features with respect to the species.

Project Overview
Data
The Iris dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The dataset also includes a categorical target variable, Species, which indicates the species of the iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Analysis
Univariate Analysis:

Histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots are generated for each feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) to understand their distributions.
Bivariate Analysis:

Pairwise relationships between features are visualized using a pairplot, which helps in identifying correlations and potential clusters among different species.
Multivariate Analysis:

Violin plots are created to show the distribution of each feature across different species.
A pairplot with KDE on the diagonal is used to highlight the relationships between features with species differentiation.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
How to Use
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code:
git clone https://github.com/Akhileshwar-2509/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-the-Iris-Dataset.git
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code:
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

Run the Analysis: Execute the provided Python script to generate the plots and visualizations.

View Results: The generated plots will be displayed and saved in the working directory.

Example Output
Histograms and KDE plots for each feature.
Pairplots showing feature relationships colored by species.
Violin plots displaying feature distributions across different species.
